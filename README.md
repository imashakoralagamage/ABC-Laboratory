User Access Rights: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to grant different levels of access to users based on their roles, such as administrators, doctors, technicians, and patients. This ensures that each user can only access the functionalities relevant to their role, enhancing security and privacy.

Interactive Interfaces: Design intuitive and user-friendly interfaces for easy navigation and interaction. Include features like dropdown menus, calendar pickers for appointment scheduling, and clear form fields for data input to enhance user experience.

Business Flow Implementation: Clearly outline the workflow of the system, starting from patient registration to test scheduling, payment, and report retrieval. Utilize flowcharts or diagrams to visualize the process and ensure smooth operation.

Report Generation: Develop reports such as appointment summaries, test results, revenue analysis, and inventory management to facilitate decision-making for both operational and managerial purposes.

Test-Driven Development (TDD): Adhere to the TDD approach by writing test cases before implementing features. This ensures that the system functions as expected, reduces bugs, and improves maintainability.
